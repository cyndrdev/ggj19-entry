1	soup	...and then I said, "that's not even her paintbrush!"
2	noodle	what, no way?
3	soup	Yeah, it surely was a tuesday to remember.
4	soup	Ah, I've missed you so much, noodle!
5	noodle	Awh, I've missed you too!
6	soup	So, did you find the place alright?
7	noodle	Yeah, it wasn't too difficult.
8	noodle	This place really is lovely, certainly a step up from your last flat!
9	noodle	I wish i had a place like this...
10	soup	I'm glad you like it!
11	soup	It's taken quite a lot of work to get it to this stage.
12	soup	I even watched an online video course on feng shui!
13	noodle	That's amazing! Was it useful?
14	soup	Well, I'll be honest, I fell asleep in the middle of the third episode...
15	noodle	Oh dear...
16	soup	So, how've you been holding up? Uni treating you well?
17	noodle	Well...
18	noodle	...
19	soup	Is everything okay?
20	noodle	Yeah, sorry.
21	noodle	Things aren't exactly going the way I imagined they would...
22	soup	Ah, that's bad to hear.
23	soup	Do you wanna talk about it?
24	noodle	Eh, in a bit...
25	noodle	Could we put some music on first?
26	soup	Sure thing!
27	soup	I still have that record we used to blast from when we were teens.
28	noodle	Ah, that'd be perfect!
29	soup	Cool, lemme go grab it.
32	noodle	Oh, this takes me back... things were easier then.
33	noodle	I remember going up on the hill to listen to this as a teenager.
34	soup	Me too, I was there. What's up, Noodle?
35	noodle	Well... it's hard, at uni. Super hard. I get lonely, and homesick.
36	noodle	I think a lot about just throwing in the towel and coming back.
37	noodle	On the one hand I'm sure my parents would support me, but on the other...
38	noodle	I don't want to feel like I'm being left behind by everyone...
39	noodle	And I do want to move forward and do things with my life, really, I do!
40	noodle	Maybe I'm scared of letting go of everything I have here, at home? I don't know.
41	soup	Just because you're going forward doesn't mean you can't look back once in a while.
42	soup	It doesn't mean you can't pine for times past, or miss old friends.
43	noodle	...
44	soup	Hey, listen. Sit there a minute and I'll go and get you a cup of tea.
45	noodle	...Thanks, I'd appreciate that, Soup.
46	soup	No problem! Milk and ten sugars, right?
47	noodle	What? Ten?
48	soup	It's a joke, silly, I'm trying to lighten the mood!
49	noodle	You're a monster.
50	soup	Hey! Don't worry, I don't even have sugar in this place. Who'd want sugar in tea?
53	soup	Milk and no sugar, as nature intended.
54	noodle	Cheers, Soup.
55	soup	Hey, look. Flying the nest is hard for everyone.
56	soup	Moving sucks at the best of times, and you went halfway across the country!
57	soup	But whoever learned anything by playing it safe?
58	soup	I often wish I'd tried harder to go to uni myself, however I feel about living here.
59	noodle	I'm not sure you'd like it...
60	soup	Maybe. Maybe not. I couldn't say for sure, and I'm not sure anyone can.
61	soup	I guess what I'm trying to say is that growing up was always going to be rocky.
62	soup	It's not like we're teenagers anymore. Everything's a little more real now, you know?
63	noodle	Mhm. Yeah, I get that for sure.
64	soup	If you're really having a rough time, don't feel pressured to stay.
65	soup	The whole point of growing up is making your own decisions, the people that matter respect that.
66	soup	But I think you left in the first place for a reason.
67	soup	And maybe that reason's worth pursuing, just for a little longer.
