1	soup	...and then I said, "that's not even her paintbrush!"
2	noodle	what, no way?
3	soup	Yeah, it surely was a tuesday to remember.
4	soup	Ah, I've missed you so much, noodle!
5	noodle	Awh, I've missed you too!
6	soup	So, did you find the place alright?
7	noodle	Yeah, it wasn't too difficult.
8	noodle	This place really is lovely, certainly a step up from your last flat!
9	noodle	I wish i had a place like this...
10	soup	I'm glad you like it!
11	soup	It's taken quite a lot of work to get it to this stage.
12	soup	I even watched an online video course on feng shui!
13	noodle	That's amazing! Was it useful?
14	soup	Well, I'll be honest, I fell asleep in the middle of the third episode...
15	noodle	Oh dear...
16	soup	So, how've you been holding up? Uni treating you well?
17	noodle	Well...
18	noodle	...
19	soup	Is everything okay?
20	noodle	Yeah, sorry.
21	noodle	Things aren't exactly going the way I imagined they would...
22	soup	Ah, that's bad to hear.
23	soup	Do you wanna talk about it?
24	noodle	Eh, in a bit...
25	noodle	Could we put some music on first?
26	soup	Sure thing!
27	soup	I still have that record we used to blast from when we were teens.
28	noodle	Ah, that'd be perfect!
29	soup	Cool, lemme go grab it.
